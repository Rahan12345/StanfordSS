# Stanford Summer Quarter

<b>STANFORD </b> ‚ù§ , the love of my Life, will always remain close to my heart. The Beautiful Weather, Highly motivated, humble and talented people all around and the crazy stuff that goes around is to die for. I miss you <b>STANFORD </b>, more than anything. The learning curve at STANFORD is beautiful; turning Ideas into reality; being the Pirate of the ship in the heart of Silicon Valley ; Doing the unexpected and the unforseen is what makes STANFORD : üî¥ <b>STANFORD</b> üî¥

The beautiful campus and the beautiful weather is the place where you want to be. In the heart of Silicon Valley; there I was, making new friends from across the globe, discovering things and getting involved with opportunities I didn't have elsewhere, meeting people whom I followed and really admired. Heart raced when you get to have breakfast with <b>JEFF DEAN</b> ; Yes! you read it right; JEFF DEAN, The GOOGLE BRAIN LEAD. Dreams turned into reality ; My whole existence just came into perception in my mind; chuckled; smiled the widest and I danced a little in the STANFORD DORM when I received an email from JEFF DEAN ; The GOD of AI, Little did I knew, What was to come, It was just the beginning , STANFORD had a lot in store for me.

<b> #PRE STANFORD </b>

Hi I am Amartya, the guy who just had breakfast with Jeff Dean üíå [ Thank You Jeff, your email meant a lot to me]. Back at home in Golaghat [ A very remote‚õ∫ and small town in INDIA] , never did I dreamt of studying at STANFORD; Life and Destiny is really beautiful. My home-place is famous for Riceüåæ cultivation and Tea‚òï ; We barely have any Computer Science group or community; lots of rice fields and rainfall. Growing up amidst the usual life of a farming town, all I had was a typical ~ 50 KB/ps Internet Connection and a craze for Computer Science Inside me. I wanted to learn Computer Science (The craze was real); I wanted to excel, I wanted to build something ; All I knew was, I want to do something for Computer Science in my life. High school went by, and just with a pentium-4 desktop setup, I wanted to know how things worked in the Computer Science world. School Carriculum didn't helped much; I knew I wanted more; I started exploring. Getting good grades until High School in CS only (nearly perfect) is what I cared for (didn't cared much about other subjects ; 9.4/10 cgpa in High school (Total); I didn't had any motivation or environment/interest to learn other subjects well); with no one to guide, little did I knew how Important was Math and Logic. I topped my Intermediate School (CBSE with 93+ %) in my small town back in 2015; In my town we didn't knew much about IIT-JEE (The Exam that we have to write to join Elite schools in India); nor did we had a single coaching centre in town, just around 2014 ,the term IIT made sense to me and I would travel 2 days a week for 3 months to a coaching centre 60-70 km away; just to get a feel how do we have to prepare for IIT JEE. Boy it's a mouthful! Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics at its peak; brain teasers and puzzles; I had very little time to begin with. Even after passing Intermediate & IIT-JEE with a good enough score; getting a seat in a good enough institute; I had to take this risk ( I wanted to go to IIT so bad ; I knew it had the best Computer Science program in India). I dropped a year; I went back home; Left Everything ; Studied (no tutor; no coaching; I was confident in myself; I was a self learner) and was pretty well prepared to appear for IIT-JEE few months before the actual date of the examination.

Alas! It had to happen; I got sucked in to start learning CS again in midst of JEE preparation. Organic Chemistry was replaced by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol ; Atoms and molecules were replaced by data packets; I was subnetting more than differentiating; Boy; I lost control and CS took over me; I was all prepared to take the CCNA exam instead of JEE. I was well versed with Routing & Switching than Integrating. Little did I knew, how important is discrete math; I would have learnt it very well by then. Gave JEE (was sad didn't make it to IIT ; but I knew it was my fault); Gave CEE( The Exam for the elite colleges in North-East India) - was relieved that I got into the topmost premiere college of North-East India (founded in 1955) and was well reputed in Eastern India. Amartya joins college; I was sad that my CS education will not be top notch; little did I knew, MOOCs were coming to my rescue(2 from IIT, 1 from Harvard, 5+ from Stanford within first few semesters of college). Machine Learning was the new cool in town. I invested time and eventually was very happy of how things turned out in my life. I also gotta tell you, I have a little bit of mischievious history; I spent a lot of time in P2P networks, forums, trackers ; I have explained it very well [here](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/DarkK) in the <b>H4CK3RS 4BO4RD</b> section. My college - Assam Engineering College (AEC) didn't had a strong Computer Science program but Life had a lot in store for me for the upcoming days in AEC. I was also happy to join collge, as I was getting my very own laptop. My step to independent learning begins here, I belong to a middle class family from a place where computers weren't much popular , still my family made sure, I was following my dreams, Thank You for believing in me <3

I haven't travelled outside my state before joining college & after 1 year in college; the <b>first ever flight</b> I got into was a sponsored trip from Google India to its Bangalore office. Yayy, I got selected as a [Google Student Facilitator](https://youtu.be/tatcYwEfvcE), I was more confident than ever before. Days went by, I gathered knowledge and experience (won 2 National Machine Learning Hackathons - including Smart India Hacktahon (considered one of the largest hackathon in the world) where I leaded my team to deploy a Deep Learning solution to tackle poaching) ; travelling almost to all the major cities of India by the time I applied to Stanford [ [Microsoft Student Partner](https://youtu.be/Mcc8B4f7D2k) took me to Rajasthan(BITS Pilani); [Smart India Hackathon](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/sih2k18) took me to Tamil Nadu ] :) also Happy to let you know that Intel supports me with hardware and software access for Deep Learning Research under their Intel AI Ambassador Program.

Amartya was skk by now; I also interned as a Computer Vision Researcher at Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology , pushing the Breast Cancer accuracy beyond benchmark & learning a lot about Computer Vision; Third Semester Ends here üö® Pheww !! I have come a long way, I love how my life shifts and turns; Destiny made a boy , who was enjoying his life within rice fields, tea gardens to experience things which he loved the most in his life :) I will not stop. I just want to learn; I dont have anything to prove anyone, nor do I care much about placement or money; All I ask my life is, just a place to learn from the core, from scratch and an environment which challenges yet supports me. At that time, I was figuring out the CERN - deep learning framework called TMVA (inside [root](https://github.com/root-project/root)) , Xavier Valls (Switzerland) and Alejandro Garc√≠a Montoro (Spain) were helping me out, I wanted to learn ; I was very excited with Deep Learning and really appreciated efforts of Fei-Fei Li (from my Vision Experience) ; Andrew NG, Daphne Koller, Ian Goodfellow and many renown researchers I came to know later; Most of them were from STANFORD and in no time I found myself surfing Stanford's website; It is then, when I discovered Stanford Summer Session; Amartya Applies to Stanford Summer Session üåã. Amartya gets IN 

I was Excited; yet a bit worried at the same time; None of my family members from any Generation travelled abroad(Outside INDIA). I just completed 2 years in college and there I was, ready to travel 12k+ km, to a completely unknown destination; to a completely opposite time zone. We came from an Agricultural background, though my Father was the first Engineer (Electrical) from my family generations; I was lucky, he had a desktop computer for his official purposes when I was young.  My Family supported me in pursuing my dreams; Cheered for me; STANFORD was something I really admired and I was confident to make it big out of the opportunity. Because I wanted it BAD; I was hungry for Silicon Valley and all the people I would meet. Californiaüåéüåâ , here comes skk.

<b> #SAN FRANCISCO üåâ‚úà </b>


<b> #STANFORD üè∞‚õÖ‚õ≤ </b>

<b> #SILICON VALLEY üåÉüöÄ </b>

<b> #POST STANFORD üåè </b>

With a heavy heart; I bid goodbye to STANFORD, group hugged my room-mate Yulong and my Good friend Laura in the San Francisco International Airport. We knew; it was a goodbye for a very long time. Goodbye üíê skk will always be there for you. Though it was only a quarter; I felt I knew them for a lifetime. It was hard, but it is the beauty of Life. My family was waiting back home. Skk flies out of SFO ; lands in INDIA (Mumbai).

By then I made a lot of new friends Internationally, who were doing amazing things in CS; The day I landed, I met my friend Kalpit Veerwal from IIT Bombay, CSE [Yes, the topmost computer science school in India] and he showed me around campus. Kalpit was the topper in IIT JEE - M , scoring a perfect 360/360; ending in Limca book of records; Yes, the same exam I didn't make through. Life is beautiful. The twists are turns in life will take you where you belong; you just have to be yourself.

Do I miss Silicon Valley ?<br/>
Yes, I do. The people ; the community; and the craziness that goes around there. With a beautiful weather, that helps concentrate and really dedicate oneself to something; is to die for. I felt leaving my second home; the place that gave me so much; the place where I felt safe and hungry each day. I wanted to be there; the projects and opportunities I would miss; the innovation and motivation I lacked; was all there. Sigh ! a deep breath, I hope someday I get to do something for Computer Science; for Humanity; I promised Guido and Ian to come back; but only time will tell. I promise I will ; someday  üå†
