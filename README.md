# Stanford Summer Quarter

<b>STANFORD </b> ‚ù§ , the love of my Life, will always remain close to my heart. The Beautiful Weather, Highly Motivated, Humble and Talented People and the crazy stuff that goes around is to die for. I miss you <b>STANFORD </b>, more than anything. The learning curve at STANFORD is beautiful; turning Idea into reality; being the Pirate of the ship in the heart of Silicon Valley ; Doing the unexpected and the unforseen is what makes STANFORD : üî¥ <b>STANFORD</b> üî¥

The beautiful campus and the beautiful weather is the place where you want to be. In the heart of Silicon Valley; there I was, making new friends from across the globe, discovering things and getting involved with opportunities I didn't had elsewhere, meeting people whom I followed and really admired. Heart raced when when you get to have breakfast with <b>JEFF DEAN</b> ; Yes! you read it right; JEFF DEAN, The GOOGLE BRAIN LEAD. Dreams turned into reality ; My whole existence just came into perception in my mind; chuckled; smiled the widest and I danced a little in the STANFORD DORM when I received an email from JEFF DEAN ; The GOD of AI, Only did I knew, It was just the beginning , what STANFORD had in store for me.

I was initially a bit scared, being the first one out of the country, for the first time from my generations of family.

After living at the heart of the Silicon Valley, at Stanford University. I can assure you, the valley is full of opportunities
