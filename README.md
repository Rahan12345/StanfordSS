Stanford Summerâ˜€ Session / Silicon Valley

Lot's of Memories, lots of dreams and . There I was, at Stanford as an undergrad student () . Excited the night, I was accepted to Stanford Summer Session

I'll write 

I was initially a bit scared, being the first one out of the country, for the first time from my generations of family.

After living at the heart of the Silicon Valley, at Stanford University. I can assure you, the valley is full of opportunities
