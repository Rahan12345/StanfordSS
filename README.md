# Stanford Summer Quarter

<b>STANFORD </b> ‚ù§ , the love of my Life, will always remain close to my heart. The Beautiful Weather, Highly motivated, humble and talented people all around and the crazy stuff that goes around is to die for. I miss you <b>STANFORD </b>, more than anything. The learning curve at STANFORD is beautiful; turning Ideas into reality; being the Pirate of the ship in the heart of Silicon Valley ; Doing the unexpected and the unforseen is what makes STANFORD : üî¥ <b>STANFORD</b> üî¥

The beautiful campus and the beautiful weather is the place where you want to be. In the heart of Silicon Valley; there I was, making new friends from across the globe, discovering things and getting involved with opportunities I didn't had elsewhere, meeting people whom I followed and really admired. Heart raced when when you get to have breakfast with <b>JEFF DEAN</b> ; Yes! you read it right; JEFF DEAN, The GOOGLE BRAIN LEAD. Dreams turned into reality ; My whole existence just came into perception in my mind; chuckled; smiled the widest and I danced a little in the STANFORD DORM when I received an email from JEFF DEAN ; The GOD of AI, Little did I knew, What was to come, It was just the beginning , STANFORD had a lot in store for me.

Hi I am Amartya, the guy who just had breakfast with Jeff Dean üíå [ Thank You Jeff, your email meant a lot for me]. Back at home in Golaghat [ A very remote and small town in INDIA] , never did I dreamt of studying at STANFORD; Life and Destiny is really beautiful. My home-place is famous for Riceüåæ cultivation and Tea‚òï ; We barely have any Computer Science group or community; lots of rice fields and rainfall. Growing up amidst the usual life of a farming town, all I had was a typical ~ 50 KB/ps Internet Connection and a craze for Computer Science Inside me. I wanted to learn Computer Science (The craze was real); I wanted to excel, I wanted to build something ; All I knew was, I want to do something for Computer Science in my life. High school went by, and just with a dual-core desktop setup, I wanted to know how things worked in the Computer Science world. School Carriculum didn't helped much; I knew I wanted more; I started exploring. Getting good grades until High School in CS only (nearly perfect) is what I cared for (didn't cared much about other subjects ; 9.4/10 in High school (Total); I didn't had any motivation or environment/interest to learn other subjects well); with no one to guide, little did I knew how Important was Math and Logic. I topped my Intermediate School (CBSE with 93+ %) in my small town back in 2015; In my town we didn't knew much about IIT-JEE (The Exam that we have to write to join Elite schools in India); nor did we had a single coaching centre in town, just around 2014 ,the term IIT made sense to me and I would travel 2 days a week for 3 months to a coaching centre 60-70 km away; just to get a feel how do we have to prepare for IIT JEE. Boy it's a mouthful! Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics at its peak; brain teasers and puzzles; I had very little time to begin with. Even after passing Intermediate & IIT-JEE with a good enough score; getting a seat in a good enough institute; I had to take this risk ( I wanted to go to IIT so bad ; I knew it had the best Computer Science program in India). I dropped a year; I went back home; Left Everything ; Studied (no tutor; no coaching; I was confident in myself; I was a self learner) and was pretty well prepared to appear for IIT-JEE few months before the actual date of the examination.
Alas! It had to happen; I got sucked in to start learning CS again in midst of JEE preparation. Organic Chemistry was replaced by OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol ; Atoms and molecules were replaced by data packets; I was subnetting instead of differnetiating;


I was initially a bit scared, being the first one out of the country, for the first time from my generations of family.

After living at the heart of the Silicon Valley, at Stanford University. I can assure you, the valley is full of opportunities
