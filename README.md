<b>STANFORD </b> ‚ù§ , the love of my Life, will always remain close to my heart. The Beautiful Weather, Highly motivated, humble and talented people all around and the crazy stuff that goes around is to die for. I miss you <b>STANFORD </b>, more than anything. The learning curve at STANFORD is beautiful; turning Ideas into reality; being the Pirate of the ship in the heart of Silicon Valley ; Doing the unexpected and the unforseen is what makes STANFORD : üî¥ <b>STANFORD</b> üî¥

The beautiful campus and the beautiful weather is the place where you want to be. In the heart of Silicon Valley; there I was, making new friends from across the globe, discovering things and getting involved with opportunities I didn't had elsewhere, meeting people whom I followed and really admired. Heart raced when when you get to have breakfast with <b>JEFF DEAN</b> ; Yes! you read it right; JEFF DEAN, The GOOGLE BRAIN LEAD. Dreams turned into reality ; My whole existence just came into perception in my mind; chuckled; smiled the widest and I danced a little in the STANFORD DORM when I received an email from JEFF DEAN ; The GOD of AI, Only didn't I knew, What was to come, It was just the beginning , STANFORD had a lot in store for me.

Hi I am Amartya, the guy who just had breakfast with Jeff Dean üíå [ Thank You Jeff, your email meant a lot for me]. Back at home in Golaghat [ A very remote and small town in INDIA] , never did I dreamt of studying at STANFORD; Life and Destiny is really beautiful. My place is famous for Riceüåæ cultivation and Tea‚òï ; We barely have any Computer Science group or community. Growing up amidst the usual life of a farming town, all I had was a typical 50 KB/ps Internet Connection and a craze for Computer Science Inside me.


I was initially a bit scared, being the first one out of the country, for the first time from my generations of family.

After living at the heart of the Silicon Valley, at Stanford University. I can assure you, the valley is full of opportunities
